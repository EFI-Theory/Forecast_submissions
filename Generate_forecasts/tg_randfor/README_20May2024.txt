On 20May2024, CJR re-trained (i.e., re-wrote the fitted model files, and deleted old ones) the chlorophyll random forests only due to errors in the past target data. 

Old chlorophyll training results are in model_traing_summaries_deprecated.csv

This required a slight update to the model training code where the 'metric' argument needed to be defined in select_best()
